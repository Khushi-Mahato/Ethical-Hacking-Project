## Network Penetration Testing with Real-World Exploits and Security Remediation

## Project Overview

This project focuses on simulating real-world network exploitation and defense scenarios using common tools and methods used in the field of cybersecurity. The objective is to provide hands-on experience in identifying vulnerabilities, exploiting them, and implementing security measures to remediate the identified risks.

|------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Network Scanning**    | Basic Network Scan (`nmap -v`)      | Identify devices, IPs, and open ports on the network |
| **Reconnaissance**      | Hidden Ports Scan (`nmap -v -p-`)   | Discover hidden ports and running services          |
|                        | Service Version Detection (`-sV`)    | Find service versions on open ports                 |
|                        | OS Detection (`-O`)                  | Detect target operating system                      |
| **Enumeration**         | Information Gathering               | Collect details: OS, MAC, open & hidden ports       |
| **Exploitation**        | Service Exploitation (3 services)   | Exploit identified vulnerabilities                  |
| **Privilege Escalation**| Create Root User (`adduser`)        | Create privileged user and retrieve hash            |
| **Password Cracking**   | Crack Password (`john --show`)      | Crack password hashes using John the Ripper         |
| **Remediation**         | Research & Patch                    | Suggest updates and patches with references         |
